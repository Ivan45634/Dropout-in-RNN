# Dropout-in-RNN
This work consists of two parts:
1. Application of a recurrent network to solve the problem of text classification. More specifically, movie review rating predictions.
2. The simplest linguistic model for text generation based on LSTM.
During the assignment, we train LSTMs with different levels of "boxing", as well as get acquainted with various ways to apply DropOut to recurrent architectures.
